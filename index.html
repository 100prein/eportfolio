                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p class="description">
                    I am Sekou Traore, a native of Bronx, New York. Following my birth in this vibrant city, I spent the formative years of my upbringing there until the age of ten. In the year 2004, I embarked on a journey to Mali, driven by the desire to reunite with my mother, brother, and sister.</p>
                    
                    <p class="description">For a span of eight years, from 2004 to 2012, I resided in Mali, contributing to the well-being of my family as the head of our household. It was during this period that I garnered valuable life experiences and honed my sense of responsibility. In the year 2012, I returned to New York, motivated by the aspiration to provide for my family while simultaneously pursuing personal growth.</p>
                    
                    <p class="description">In 2014, I achieved the significant milestone of earning my GED/TASC, thereby demonstrating my commitment to academic excellence and personal development. As a devoted father to my son, I recognized the profound influence of my role in his life. Fueled by this awareness, I resolved to set an inspiring example for him and others by attaining a higher level of education.</p>
                    
                    <p class="description">In pursuit of this goal, I dedicated myself to my studies and successfully acquired an associate's degree in Programming and Software Development. This accomplishment not only signifies my academic prowess but also underscores my determination to navigate challenges and achieve objectives.</p>
                    
                    <p class="description">My journey from Bronx to Mali and back to New York, my commitment to family, academic endeavors, and personal growth have collectively molded me into a steadfast individual with a resolute vision for the future.</p>
