I was not able to assign roles to eavery member until we finished brainstorming, wrote our project proposal and watched an example of a final presentation from previous class. It roles and assignments are given as we go on with our project until the finish line.</p>
                <p class="description">Every team member have different schedules, so I must come up with a schedule that suits everyone. I created couple of polls on Whatsapp to finally come up with a time to meet weekly. There were moments where we would meet twice a week during midterms.</p>
                <p class="description">There were concerns about sharing our web design and chatbot for the presentation. I combined the Chatbot and our website. I used GitHub to share our code and live static website so anyone can visit it.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p class="description">Our project was a success not just because of knowledge and experience but with my classmates who were willing to work together and complete their assigned tasks. I want them to succeed as well as they want me to succeed in this project. Throughout the semester, we understood what are our problems and overcome them by figuring out to solve or improvise. With empathy, I assisted some of classmates to complete their tasks as school and work took over their schedule sometimes as well as they assisted me with my tasks I should have completed. Without them, this project would be near impossible to meet the deadline. I am so proud of the work we have done as a member of team 1! </p>
