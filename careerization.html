                <h2>Technologies Used and Roles</h2>
                <p class="description"> My partner started the project with HTML, and CSS; Then I proceeded with PHP. We used Visual Studio Code to do our work. When it was time to use a database, I created a database on <abbr title="MySQL Workbench is a unified visual tool for database architects, developers, and Database Administrators. MySQL Workbench provides data modeling, SQL development, and comprehensive administration tools for server configuration, user administration, backup, and much more.">Workbench</abbr> that connected to our website and use MySQL to modify data.  </p><p class="description">I was responsible for the back-end, managing database and connecting it to our website. My partner was responsible for the front-end, designing, structuring and styling our website.</p>

                <p class="description"> The challenges we had with the project was sharing the files through cloud. We did not have time to meet in person to do the project, so I compressed the files for our website and send it to her to manage to front-end.</p>
                <p class="description">Few days later, her Visual Code Studio was not able to work on our project. I requested her to send me the compressed files so I can take over the front-end.</p>
                <p class="description">I was using PHP to connect to two tables in my Database on Workbench; however, the second table was not working. It took me several days to figure it out. I took a break from it as I was getting cranky. When I returned, I notice the ID of each tables are identical. I renamed the id of the second table different than the first one, and it worked like heaven!</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p class="description">Our project was a success not just because of knowledge and experience but with my classmates who were willing to work together and complete their assigned tasks. I want them to succeed as well as they want me to succeed in this project. Throughout the semester, we understood what are our problems and overcome them by figuring out to solve or improvise. With empathy, I assisted some of classmates to complete their tasks as school and work took over their schedule sometimes as well as they assisted me with my tasks I should have completed. Without them, this project would be near impossible to meet the deadline. I am so proud of the work we have done as a member of team 1! </p>
